-----------netCrack guide-----------

netCrack is a tool used to automate an attack on a wifi access point.
It is wizard-based like all undertaker tools.
It uses a a multi-step process, divided by the dependencies used.

-----------The process-------------

Step one: Setup

This is a small step, primarily used to set up a WLAN1 interface in monitor mode. It uses airmon-ng as a dependency.
You will shut down all network connections, and active a WLAN1 interface ready for the next step.

Step two: Monitoring

Check for Wireless networks to monitor, then choose one. This step will show wireless networks and their connected clients,
as well as set up other settings for later stages of the process. This uses airodump-ng as a dependency.
Depending if you choose to do step three, you may or may not capture the WPA handshake here.

Step three (optional): Deauthing

WPA handshakes hapen often, but not everyone is willing to wait that long. In that case, you can force it with a deauth.
Using aireplay-ng as a dependency, you will start a deauth process to force a WPA handshake to occur and then capture it.

Step four: Cleanup

Now that you have the handshake that you came for, you will clean up the settings of the first step of this process.
This will involve restarting NetworkManager and stopping your WLAN1 interface.

Step five: Cracking the handshake

Now, unless you choose to terminate netCrack here and crack the handshake at a later date, you will crack the captured handshake file. 
You will have the option to use one of two dependencies, Hashcat or aircrack-ng. Both will be cracked using simple wordlist attacks.
If you do not have a wordlist, you will be prompted to create one using a program like crunch or cupp.
